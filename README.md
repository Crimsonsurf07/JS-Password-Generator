                              My Javascript Password Generator Project

					Summary

The purpose of this assignment was to test our basic understanding of JavaScript we just acquired pertaining to functions, loops, arrays, if statements, ect. We were provided with the HTML and CSS allowing us to focus on the task at hand. Adding functionality to the currently non-functional Password Generator. Resulting in a password being generated after a series of Question Prompts / Confirms are answered by the user. The user input to the questions determines the length and the the security strength of the password being generated.

This assignment was pretty challenging as I am new to learning the Javascript concepts. I did frequently consult the learning material provided by The UNC Chapel Hill Bootcamp during the learning module as well as utilized w3schools. Majority of the assignment was completed through trial and error, console.log() just about everything to see if I was going to achieve the desired result. A few bugs were discovered along the way using the Console in Google Chrome and this was able to assist me quite a bit in not only identifying problems in the code I had just written. But also in finding a solution that would work with the rest of my code. 

Below is a series of Screen Shots Illustrating some of the prompt questions the user will be asked.:
